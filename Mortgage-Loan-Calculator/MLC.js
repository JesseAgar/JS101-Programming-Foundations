/*
*UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
  - read the problem description 
  - examine all given examples for info
  - identify INPUTS/OUTPUTS
? the loan amount
? the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) in percent (10%)
? the loan duration in months
  - identify RULES/REQUIREMENTS
? monthly interest rate
? calculate loan duration in months
  - mental model problem. Sort of like a VERY simple algorithm. Just describe what you broadly need to do.
? get input of the 3 numbers, then calculate the monthly loan amount
  - ask clarifying questions

*EXAMPLES/TEST CASES
  - understand how the input translates to output
  - identify VALID CASES
? positive numbers all round
? is a number
  - identify EDGE CASES
? numbers with $ or % in the name
? negative numbers
  - create the test cases and confirm outputs */


  /* !DATA STRUCTURES
    - what sort of actions do you have to do (sort, collect, filter, etc.)
    - what kind of data are you primarily dealing with? (strings, arrays, numbers, objects, etc.)
    - focus on methods for these types
  ?
  
*ALGORITHM
    - step by step process that takes you from input to output, your code will depend on your algorithm
    - handles edges cases and valid example inputs 
  ? Get loan amount
  ? Check validity, get again if invalid
  ? Get APR
  ? Check validity, get again if invalid
  ? get loan duration
  ? Check validity, get again if invalid
  ?
  ? input numbers into equation
  ? output results in a sentence
