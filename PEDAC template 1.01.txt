/*
*UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
  - read the problem description 
  - examine all given examples for info
  - identify INPUTS/OUTPUTS
?
  - identify RULES/REQUIREMENTS
?
  - mental model problem. Sort of like a VERY simple algorithm. Just describe what you broadly need to do.
?
  - ask clarifying questions

*EXAMPLES/TEST CASES
  - understand how the input translates to output
  - identify VALID CASES
?
  - identify EDGE CASES
?
  - create the test cases and confirm outputs */
  exampleFunction(input) //! expected output

  /* !DATA STRUCTURES
    - what sort of actions do you have to do (sort, collect, filter, etc.)
    - what kind of data are you primarily dealing with? (strings, arrays, numbers, objects, etc.)
    - focus on methods for these types
  ?
  
*ALGORITHM
    - step by step process that takes you from input to output, your code will depend on your algorithm
    - handles edges cases and valid example inputs
  ? 
  ?
  ? 
  ?
  ?
  ?
  
*CODE
    - write the code
    - if there are errors:
      - carefully review algorithm before looking at your code
      - change the algorithm first if necessary
      - then fix the code
